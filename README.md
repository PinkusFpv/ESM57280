# Huawei Battery Pack CAN Bus Reverse Engineering

This repository provides an introduction and a practical starting point for reverse-engineering the Huawei battery pack CAN bus, enabling direct access to telemetry data (voltage, temperature, etc.) from the Battery Management System (BMS).

## üõ†Ô∏è Battery Overview

This battery pack comprises **18 lithium-ion cells** connected in series. It is controlled via two integrated systems:

- **Battery Management System (BMS)**
- **Energy Management System (EMS)**

Our mission is to extract telemetry data directly from the BMS through the CAN bus.

## üîé Hardware Inspection

**Step 1: Opening the Battery Pack**

Open the battery covers by pressing the marked points:

Underneath the cover, you‚Äôll find connections for:

- **COM2.0 Communication (CAN Bus)**
- **48‚ÄØV DC Auxiliary Supply**
- **Manual Start Pinout**

**Step 2: Accessing the BMS Module**

Further disassembly by removing the four screws gives direct access to the **Battery Management Module (BMS)**.

In the battery‚Äôs passive state, the output is disconnected internally by the EMS, but you can access terminals directly at the marked bolts if necessary.

## üö¶ Activating the Battery Pack

To activate the battery fully, two key conditions must be satisfied:

1. **48‚ÄØV Auxiliary Power** to boot up the BMS electronics.
2. **Valid CAN Communication**, a proprietary Huawei handshake is required.

### Manual Start Pin Test

Connecting manual-start pins alone results in:

- An initial **orange LED**, followed by a **blinking green LED**.
- Battery deactivates after ~1 minute, indicating the need for valid CAN communication.

## üîå COM Port (RJ45) Pinout

The battery‚Äôs COM port (8-pin RJ45 style) integrates both communication and auxiliary power:

| Pin(s) | Function                           |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| 6      | CAN Low (CAN-L)                    |
| 12     | CAN High (CAN-H)                   |
| 1,2,3  | Auxiliary 48‚ÄØV Positive Input (V+) |
| 7,8,9  | Auxiliary Negative/Ground (V‚àí)     |

> 1,2 and 7,8 are internal connected  
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Merely bridging pins (without proper CAN communication) **will NOT fully activate** the battery pack.

## üîã Official Charger Procedure (Huawei DCLT-7050)

The recommended Huawei charger (DCLT-7050) provides both the required CAN signals and auxiliary power:

1. **CAN & Aux Cable**: Connect charger to battery COM port (pins listed above).
2. **DC Power**: Connect charger cables to battery terminals.
3. **Power On**: Switch on the charger‚Äôs AC & DC breakers.
4. **CAN Handshake**: Charger initiates the proprietary CAN handshake.
5. **Activation**: BMS internal relays close, starting the charging process.

*Without CAN communication, the battery remains idle.*

## üåê Community Insights

- Huawei batteries rely on proprietary CAN protocols derived from Modbus/RS485.
- Direct pin bridging or standard CAN controllers usually fail to activate the battery.
- Community attempts show success requires reverse-engineering official CAN frames.

---

## üïµÔ∏è Next Steps for Reverse Engineering

- Use a CAN sniffer to capture traffic between the official DCLT-7050 charger and battery.
- Analyze and decode the proprietary CAN messages.
- Replicate CAN communication independently to activate battery and read telemetry data.
